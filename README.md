# Dimension-Mapping-System
Warehouses require efficient space management and precise floor mapping to optimize storage and automation. Traditional mapping methods are time-consuming and prone to human errors. This paper proposes an autonomous spherical bot capable of floor plan generation and dimension mapping using Ultrasonic sensor, MPU.The bot navigates autonomously, collects spatial data, and generates a detailed warehouse floor plan. The implementation of this system improves operational efficiency, reduces manual labor, and enhances inventory management. The results demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of deploying spherical robots for warehouse mapping.
